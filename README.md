==============

My personal technology blog about Java, Scala, Big Data and Web Development.

The site is implemented using [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll), a static blogging tool. 
Jekyll is the engine behind [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com).

The jekyll source code is checked into this repository on the branch 
[source](https://github.com/jousby/jousby.github.io/tree/source). The site that is generated from this source
is then checked into [master](https://github.com/jousby/jousby.github.io). The reason for this approach was
so that I could make use of Jekyll plugins and generate the site prior to checking it in and pushing to Github.
